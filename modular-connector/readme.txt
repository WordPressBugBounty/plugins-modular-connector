### Manage and monitor all your WordPress sites in one place

Connect your WordPress sites to Modular DS, access them with one-click login, and manage centralized updates, backups, security scans, uptime monitoring, and more in a single dashboard.

Stay organized with tags and teams, and assign custom roles and permissions to collaborators.

### Bulk updates and management

Update, install, activate, or delete plugins, themes, and WordPress versions across multiple websites at once (or one by one).

### Backups and restores

Schedule regular, GDPR-compliant backups to safeguard your clients’ sites and data, or create one manually whenever you need.

Choose between full or incremental backups and easily restore entire sites, files, or databases from Modular DS.

### Uptime monitoring

Never get caught off guard by downtime. Get notified by email, WhatsApp, Slack, or Discord when any of your websites go down, before your clients even notice.

Customize check frequency, response time, keyword detection, and alert settings to fit your workflow. Modular DS includes one of the most complete uptime monitor tools for WordPress.

### Safer, smarter plugin updates

Update Copilot, our AI-powered scoring system, helps you understand how risky a plugin update might be before applying it. It analyzes multiple factors, such as code changes and the historical reliability of the plugin and the latest version based on other users, so you don’t have to make update decisions blindly.

Pair it with safe updates to create restore points, compare “before and after” changes, and instantly roll back if anything goes wrong.

### Health, performance, and security scans

Catch vulnerabilities in plugins, themes, and WordPress core up to 48 hours before they’re publicly disclosed, thanks to our integration with Patchstack.

Stay on top of your sites’ health, performance, and security with alerts whenever other issues or errors require your attention, like outdated PHP or an expired SSL certificate.

### Database optimization

Clean up post revisions, spam comments, transients, orphaned tables, and more directly from Modular DS. No need for extra plugins.

Keep your websites running smoothly while saving time and having a clear record of every optimization made.

### Client reports

Automatically generate and send professional maintenance reports that highlight the work you do behind each site, so clients understand the value of your service and keep paying for it.

Add time logs, dates, and screenshots to showcase the full scope and impact of your efforts.

Reports help you build trust, improve client retention, and turn your WordPress maintenance offering into recurring revenue.

### Integrations

Modular DS integrates with Google Analytics, Search Console, WooCommerce, and PageSpeed, giving you an overview of your websites in one place and allowing you to include the data your clients care most about in your reports.

To further strengthen your sites’ security, our Patch & Protect add-on, powered by Patchstack, lets you block vulnerabilities with virtual patching and hardening rules as soon as they’re detected, even before an official update is available.
