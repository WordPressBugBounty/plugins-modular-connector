== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is website maintenance important? =

Absolutely, specially when working with WordPress. Maintenance isn’t just about updates, which are essential for performance and security; it covers many aspects that help keep a website in good shape over time.

From backups and uptime monitoring to vulnerability tracking and plugin management, keeping everything under control helps prevent small issues from turning into bigger problems (and frustrated clients).

If you offer this service, maintenance is also a way to provide ongoing value and peace of mind. Modular DS helps you cover all these fronts efficiently and deliver high-quality service with confidence.

= Is Modular DS free? =

Modular DS offers a free plan that lets you connect up to 5 websites and explore its feature set in its basic version.

Premium plans start at $34/month and scale with your needs. Whether you manage 10 or 100 websites, you only pay for the plan — with no per-site fees or paid add-ons for core features.

= Do I have to host my websites with a specific hosting provider? =

No, Modular DS works independently of your hosting provider. You can connect and manage websites hosted anywhere.

= Is Modular DS secure? =
Yes, it is. Modular DS uses the OAuth2 protocol to securely authenticate the connection between your website and our servers. This protocol generates tokens that expire and can be revoked at any time.

We never store your WordPress user passwords, ensuring your login credentials remain private and under your control.

= How does Modular DS stand out from other existing solutions? =

We’ve placed strong emphasis on building an excellent user experience, so you can manage all your websites in the simplest, most intuitive way possible — something our customers love and consistently highlight in their reviews.

Modular DS also stands out for its bilingual support (English and Spanish), delivered by a dedicated team that’s there when you need them. Plus, the platform is in active development, with frequent updates, improvements, and new features added regularly.

= What does the plugin Modular Connector do? =

The Modular Connector plugin links your WordPress installation with Modular DS, enabling secure communication between both systems. It allows actions like plugin updates, backup scheduling, and other maintenance tasks to be triggered from the Modular DS dashboard.
