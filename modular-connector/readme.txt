Connect and manage all your WordPress websites in an easier and more efficient way. Backups, bulk updates, Uptime Monitor, vulnerabilities, client reports and much more.

== Description ==

Modular DS is the tool you need to improve your web maintenance processes and get your clients to value your work. In order to save time on day-to-day tasks while getting more recurring maintenance contracts.

With [Modular DS](https://modulards.com/en/) you will have a centralized panel from which to control and access all your WordPress websites to perform tasks such as:

* __Managing plugins, themes and WordPress__ versions in bulk. Updating, activating, deactivating, deleting...
* Status monitoring (__Uptime__) and SSL.
* Cloud __backups__ (__RGPD__ compliant)
* __Health and vulnerability__ monitoring
* __Maintenance reports for clients__ with statistics from Google Analytics, Search Console, PageSpeed, WooCommerce and any task performed on the website.

And what's more, you'll find a committed team on the other side that you can talk to whenever you need to. Because even though Modular is a software, there are people behind it.

[Try it now](https://app.modulards.com/register) and connect up to 5 websites with our free plan and see the time and headaches it saves you.

### All your websites in one place

Connect all your websites to Modular and organize them by teams or assign different tags to them so that you can easily control them from a single panel.

### Manage plugins, themes, WordPress versions...

On all your websites at once or one at a time. Control and update plugins, themes and WordPress versions without having to log in to the admin. And also, receive alerts when one of the versions you have installed has a known vulnerability.

### Backups

Leave your worries behind. Rest assured with an automatic backup system so that, no matter what happens, your client's website is protected. Recover your backup in just a few minutes by selecting the files you want to restore. RGPD compliant.

### Client reports

Automatically generate and send maintenance reports for your clients. With all the information about updates, statistics (Analytics and Search Console), performance, backups and even adding custom tasks you do for them. With dedicated hours, dates and screenshots.

### Uptime Monitor

Receive email or SMS alerts when your website is down. Because you can't always be aware of what's happening on all your sites and the last thing you want is an angry client telling you that their website is down.

Select the frequency of the checks, expected response time, words to search and even the time it takes to notify you. One of the best and most complete Uptime Monitor plugins for WordPress.

### Great support

We are the first tool on the market with support in English and Spanish. Because you deserve someone who understands you without complications.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is website maintenance important? =

Yes, a lot. And even more so with WordPress. And we're not just talking about updates (necessary for security and performance). If you are a professional and offer this service to your clients, you must make sure you have everything under control. For that, you need backups, an uptime monitor service, to be aware of vulnerabilities that may arise, etc...

= Is Modular DS free? =

Modular DS has a free plan with which you can connect up to 5 websites and test all the features in its basic version. With the premium plans, starting at 29â‚¬ per month, you will be able to connect unlimited websites and have access to all the features.

= Do I have to have my websites hosted on a specific hosting company? =

No, Modular DS works independently of your hosting service.

= Is Modular DS secure? =

Yes, we use the oAuth2 protocol for authentication of the connection between your website and our servers. Thanks to this protocol we generate tokens with expiration and revocable at any time. In addition, we do not store any WordPress user passwords.

= How does Modular DS stand out from other existing solutions? =

We have put a lot of emphasis on making the user experience of the application excellent. So you can manage all your websites in the simplest and most intuitive way possible. Something our clients love (you can see the plugin reviews). We are also constantly updating the tool and releasing new features.

= What does the plugin Modular Connector do? =

Modular Connector bridges the gap between your WordPress and Modular DS. Something fundamental for both systems to communicate easily, allowing commands such as plugin updates or backup scheduling to go back and forth.
